# ⭐ **Axiom Update 4.2**

This update mainly focuses on **stability**, **autotime improvements**, and cleaning up core systems.
A good amount of internal problems should finally be gone.

## ⚙️ **Engine Updates**

* Added back authentication detections(HWID Mismatch, License not found, etc).
* Reworked and improved threading logic.
* Threads can now **restart safely** (UI overlay, player objects, ESP, etc).
* Fixes issues where:
  * ESP/Aimbot suddenly stopped working
  * UI crashing
  * Features required a full restart
  * Overall engine should hopefully be more stable


## 🖥️ **UI Updates**

* Added **GUI Types** (2 experimental styles for now).
* Added **FPS UI** for lower-end PCs to help improve performance and clarity.

## 🎨 **Visual Updates**

* Updated ESP visuals.
* Updated tracers

## 📦 **Base Fixes**

* Fixed **uncolored** text issues.
* Fixed **unsorted** text appearing in menus or lists.

## 🏀 **Practical Basketball**

* Added **Self Improver** (untested.. I literally cannot test this, so we wait until it comes out, it might not be the best though, or work at all).

## **Executor**

* Executor system has been added!
* Not released yet! Code is finished but will be posted **next update(hopefully)**.
* Unsure how long I will maintain this project, could be one more update or several. We’ll see.
